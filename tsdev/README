README - tsdev.c
CREATED: 05/08/09

================================================================================
This device file currently accepts reading and writing operations. Open and 
close are not supported (though that might not be a bad thing to add in the 
future... this is primarily a skeleton). The device currently stores a very small
local buffer (we can change the size easily) which you can write to. Every time
you write to it, the device's buffer is overwritten. There is no error checking
for reading/writing sizes, so that's another thing we need to do. If you read
it once, it empties the buffer and gives it to the caller. If it's already empty,
it'll print a message indicating so. 

Note: There might be an issue in the loading of the module when you restart your
	machine. I had to reinstall the module when I restarted. It works fine
	after you do that though.

Currently this has only been tested on my virtual Ubuntu 8.10 machine. It runs
on the 2.6.27-11-generic kernel.

To install:
While in this directory,
1. make
2. sudo insmod ./tsdev.ko

From here you should be able to 
sudo cat /dev/tsdev
and
sudo echo "Whatever String" > /dev/tsdev

To allow regular users to access the device, 
    1. sudo cp tsdev.rules /etc/udev/
    2. sudo ln -s ../tsdev.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/010_tsdev.rules
    3. sudo rmmod tsdev
    4. sudo insmod ./tsdev.ko

To test if the symbolink link was created successfully, do
    1. ls -l /dev/tsdev*
You should see two files, one being a link to the other.

From here on out, you can read or write strings to the device.
