Simple test app to demonstrate the use of liblo.
Liblo is configured to compile as a dynamically-linked library.
As a result the app must be ran as a shell script.
When 'make' is ran the executable is placed in .libs/
Use ./server to run the demo.

Demo blocks on socket port 33333 and waits for TUIO.
Use TUIO_Simulator for demo.
