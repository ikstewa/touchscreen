================================================================================
     This is the device that will accept and output TUIO information through
     its read/write functions. The device will only accept one reader and one
     writer at a time. If the device is already being used -EBUSY is returned.
     A read requires a buffer of sufficient length to include the entire data.
     No partial messages are returned, -EINVAL if buffer length unacceptable.
 
     The device currently buffers up to BUF_COUNT messages of length BUF_LEN.
     A message is read only once, than is no longer available. If a message is
     not read before BUF_COUNT messages have been written, following writes 
     will overide old messages.
 

Note: There might be an issue in the loading of the module when you restart your
	machine. I had to reinstall the module when I restarted. It works fine
	after you do that though.

Currently this has only been tested on my virtual Ubuntu 8.10 machine. It runs
on the 2.6.27-11-generic kernel and the 2.6.29 kernel.

To install:
While in this directory,
1. make
2. sudo insmod ./tuio.ko

From here you should be able to 
sudo cat /dev/tuio
and
sudo echo "Whatever String" > /dev/tuio

To allow regular users to access the device, 
    1. sudo cp tuio.rules /etc/tuio/
    2. sudo ln -s ../tuio.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/010_tuio.rules
    3. sudo rmmod tuio
    4. sudo insmod ./tuio.ko

To test if the symbolink link was created successfully, do
    1. ls -l /dev/tuio*
You should see two files, one being a link to the other.

From here on out, you can read or write strings to the device.
